lolita the light of my life the fire of my loins
my sin my soul my
lo li ta
the tip of the tongue makes a three step journey down the spine
to the roof of your mouth so that you can bump into your teeth on the third one
lo
li
ta
she was a lo just a lo in the morning five feet tall
without any hair
two tops and one sock
she was lola in long pants
she was dolly at school
she was dolores on the dotted line of forms
she was always in my arms
lolita
did she have any predecessors
of course they were
more i will say
and lolita would not have turned out at all if i had not fallen in love with her
one distant summer one primordial girl
in a certain sense a principality by the sea
almost like po
when was that eh
approximately the same number of years before lolita was born as i was that summer
you can always rely on the killer in with regard to the intricacy of prose
dear female and male jurors exhibit number the first is what the edgarovs were so envious of seraphim poorly informed simple minded noble winged the seraphim
look at this tangle of thorns
i was born in paris in
my father was different soft of heart easy of temper and a whole vinaigrette of genes
there was a swiss citizen half french half austrian with a danube river
veined
i'm going to give out some pretty ones glossy blue postcards
he owned a luxury hotel on the riviera
his father and both grandfathers traded in wine diamonds and silks
by yourself
at the age of thirty he married an englishwoman the daughter of a mountaineer jerome dunne granddaughter of two dorset pastors who are experts in the history of intricate subjects
paleopedology and aeolian harps
distribute them yourself
circumstances and cause of my death very photogenic mothers were quite original
picnic lightning
i was only three years old at the time and apart from some a warm cul de sac in the darkest past i don't have anything from her
left in the hollows and hollows of memory behind which if you still able to stand my syllable
i write under supervision
sits down the sun of my infancy
you all probably know these words
the balmy remnants of the day that hang with the midges above some blooming hedge that you suddenly find yourself in on the road
walking through them at the foot of the hill in the summer dusk deep warmth golden midges
her mother's older sister sybil who was married to a cousin my father's brother who soon left her lived with us in the house as a free governess or housekeeper
i later heard that she was in love with my father and that once on a rainy day he thoughtfully took advantage of it
i forgot everything as soon as the weather cleared up
i was extremely attached to her despite the severity fatal severity some of its rules
maybe she wanted to do i'm a more virtuous widower than my father
at aunt sybil's her eyes were azure and rimmed with pink and her complexion was waxy
she wrote poetry
she was poetically superstitious
she said she knew when he dies which is when i turn sixteen and and so it happened
her husband a seasoned traveller from a perfume company firms spent most of his time in america where at the end of i started my own business and bought some property
i grew up as a happy healthy child in the bright world of books with pictures clean sand orange trees friendly people dogs sea urchins and smiling faces
all around me is gorgeous the mirana palace hotel revolved around a private universe a whitewashed chalk space in the middle of another blue huge sparked from the outside
from the aproned kitchen man to the king in a summer suit everyone loved me everyone spoiled me
elderly people the american women leaned over me leaning on their walking sticks
leaning towers of pisa
ruined russian princesses could not pay to my father but they bought me expensive candy
aka mon cher petit rara used to take me boating and cycling he taught me to swim dive water ski read to me don quixote and les miserables and i adored and revered him and i was happy for him when i overheard the servants talking
they discuss his various mistresses affectionate beauties who took a lot of time with me cooing over me and spilling blood
precious tears over my quite hilarious motherlessness
i went to an english school that was several miles away
miles from home where i played rockets and fives
hitting the ball
hit the wall with a racket or a hand got excellent marks and he got along well with both his friends and mentors
до thirteen years old
i
e
before i met my little annabella
as far as i remember i had only two experiences definitely of the sexual order
solemn decent and exclusively theoretical talk about some unexpected things the phenomena of adolescence which took place in the rose garden of the school with an american boy the son of a famous then a cinematic actress he rarely saw in the world
measurements
and quite an interesting response from my take a look at pearl matte shots with endlessly delicate lips
shadow recesses in pichon's lush album la beaute humaine which i quietly pulled out one day from under a pile of marble volumes london graphic in the hotel library
later father co with his usual complacency he gave me information of this kind which he thought i might need
that was in the fall in before i entered the gymnasium in lyon
where i was born
i had three winters to spend
but it was the summer of that year my father alas was absent he was traveling around italy with mme de r
and her daughter so i had no one to complain to not with her
who to consult
annabella was like the author of mixed parentage
in this case english and dutch
currently i remember her features were much less distinct than he remembered them before
i met lolita
visual memory has two approaches
you manage to create an image in the brain lab skillfully without having to closing one eye
and then annabella introduces herself to me in general terms
terms like honey colored skin thin hands cropped brown hair long eyelashes big bright mouth
in another case you close your eyes and instantly call for help
dark inner side of the eyelids objective optical extreme faithful reproduction of your favorite traits
the little ghost in the natural colors
and that's how i see lolita
let me therefore limit my description of annabella to with the decorous remark that it was a charming girl for several years
months younger than me
her parents surnamed leigh are old my aunt's friends like aunt sybil were as scrupulous about their own affairs
respect for decency
they were renting a villa near the mirana
this bald brown mr
li and the fat powdered lady lee
born vanessa van ness
i hated it so much
first we are with annabella was being talked around so to speak
that's what it is delo picked up a handful of fine beach sand and gave it to him fall through your fingers
our brains were tuned to match the smart ones to european teenagers of that time and environment and i doubt it so that you can find any individual talent in our interest in the multiplicity of inhabited worlds tennis competitions infinity solipsism and the like
the tenderness and vulnerability of the young animals aroused something in both of us
the same acute suffering
she wanted to be a nurse in the hospital
some starving asian country
i dreamed of being a famous spy
all of a sudden we were madly in love with each other clumsily shamelessly painfully
i might add hopelessly because our frenzied desire for mutual possession could be it would be satisfied only if each of us really absorbed and i have assimilated every particle of the other's body and soul
yet we don't even know what it is
they could find places where they could copulate as they easily do slum kids
after one failed late night date at her apartment the garden
about which in the next chapter
is the only thing that we needed allowed in the sense of meetings is to lie within reach adults visually if not audibly on the part of the beach where there were only the most people
there on the soft sand a few feet away a few steps away from the elders we lay in a dazed frenzy all morning and they took advantage of every blessed flaw in their love life
fabrics of time and space to touch each other
her hand through the sand crept up to me moved closer and closer
closer moving his narrow tanned fingers and then hers
the mother of pearl knee went on the same long careful journey
travel
sometimes a random rampart constructed by other children younger serving as a cover for a quick salty kiss
these imperfect contacts brought our healthy and inexperienced bodies to such a degree of irritation that even the coolness blue water under which we continued to pursue our goal she couldn't calm us down
among the treasures i lost in my later wanderings there was a small photograph taken by my aunt that captured a group of people sitting at a sidewalk cafe table
annabella her mother and her mother
parents and a very sedate dr
cooper a lame old man who was courting aunt sybil that summer
annabella didn't come out
too good because i was caught in the moment when she did it
i was going to take a sip of my chocolat face and only on the skinny naked the shoulders and parting in the middle could be recognized as hers
since i remember the picture
among the solar turbidity in which gradually and irrevocably her beauty crossed over and i sitting in profile was a little surprised
apart from the others he came out with some dramatic relief
a sullen thick browed boy in a dark sports shirt and white jeans
well cut shorts crossing his legs and looking out the window
side
the photo was taken on the last day of our fateful journey
summer just a few minutes before our second and last attempts to deceive fate
under some extremely transparent an excuse
there was no other chance and nothing else mattered values
we left the cafe for the beach where we finally found a secluded place and there in the purple shade of pink rocks as we formed a sort of cave we quickly exchanged greedy glances
weasels the only witness of which were dropped by someone dark glasses
i was on my knees ready to take my hand
darling how suddenly two bearded bathers grandfather of the sea and his brother came out of the water shouting obscene things
four months later she died of typhus on the island
i flip through these pathetic memories again and again and that's it i ask myself if it's from there if it's from the splendor of that place
a long ago summer crack went through my whole life
or maybe perhaps my acute fascination with this child was only the first a sign of congenital perversion
when i try to understand the in my past desires intentions actions i succumb to a certain reverse imagination which feeds the analytical ability the possibilities are limitless so that anyone who presents himself to me the past path splits endlessly into forks in the stupefyingly complex memory loss
i am sure however that magical and fatal lolita started with annabella
i also know that annabella's death cemented dissatisfaction that delusional summer and became an obstacle to any other love during the cold years of my youth
spiritual and physical it merged in our love in such a perfect measure that it did not exist before
dreamed of today's just looking at everything teenagers with their simple feelings and cliched brains
long after her and i could feel her thoughts flowing through mine
long before before we met we had the same dreams
we compared milestones
they found strange similarities
in june of the same year
to her house and to my house in two non contiguous countries a canary fluttered in
oh lolita if you only loved me so
i've reserved a description of our meeting for the end of my story about annabella
a miserable first date
late one night she managed to deceive the malicious vigilance of parents
in a grove of nervous trees among the thin leaved mimosa trees behind the villa we found a spot on the the ruins of a low stone wall
in the dark through the gentle the trees were covered with arabesques of the villa's lighted windows
now lightly touched up with colored ink sensitive for example i would compare it to playing cards
partly maybe because the enemy was playing bridge there
she shuddered and she twitched as i kissed the corner of her parted lips and the back of her mouth
a hot earlobe
a scattering of stars burned palely above us between them silhouettes of elongated leaves
this responsive abyss seemed to be as naked as she was under her light dress
against the sky her face stood out with a strange clarity as if from the sun
it gave off a faint glow of its own
her legs her lovely legs lively legs were not too tightly clenched and when my hand i found what i was looking for an expression of some kind of mermaid's beauty
dreaminess either pain or pleasure appeared on her face
a child's face
sitting a little higher than me she is in her lonely bliss she was reaching for my lips her head bowed sleepily
with a languid movement that was almost pained and her bare hands were still wet
my knees caught and squeezed my hand then went weak again
her trembling mouth twisting with the bitterness of the mysterious potion with a slight gasp coming close to my face
she tried to soothe the pain of love
that abruptly she rubbed her dry lips against mine but suddenly she swerved away from me
with an impetuous flutter of her curls and then again she clung gloomily to me
she allowed me to feed on her open mouth while i magnanimously ready to give her everything my heart my throat i let her hold the scepter in her clumsy fist
passion
i remember the smell of some kind of powder which i think she stole from me
spanish maid mother sweet cheap musky it smelled like her own sponge cake and it was a little sweet
suddenly the cup of my senses was filled to the brim
an unexpected a commotion under a nearby bush prevented them from spilling over
we froze and they listened to the noise with a painful shudder in their veins produced probably just by a hunted cat
but at the same time alas mrs
li's voice came from the direction of the house calling out to his daughter with wildly increasing ripples and dr
cooper he limped heavily out of the porch and into the garden
but this mimosa patch the mist of stars the chill the fire the honeydew and my torment were left with me
me and this girl with her legs ironed by the sea and a fiery face
it has haunted me ever since until at last twelve four years later i didn't break the spell by resurrecting her in another one
the days of my youth as i look back on them seem to fly away from me
me in a pale swirl of repeated scraps like morning mint used pieces of paper visible to an american express passenger through the rear observation window of the last car they were in
they curl
in my hygienic relations with women i was practical mocking and quick
during my university years in in london and paris i was satisfied with paid trips
my classes they were diligent and diligent in their studies but not very fruitful
at first i thought of becoming a psychiatrist like so many losers
but i i was a special loser
i was strangely tired
i have to go to the doctor such a longing
and i went on to study english literature which is used more than once the empty flower poet turning into a professor with a pipe in a jacket made of good quality wool
the paris of the thirties was a good time for me
i discussed soviet films with american writers
i sat with the uranists in the cafe des deux magots
i was typing tortuous sketches in poorly read magazines
i wrote parodies on eliot for example
let fraulein von kulp still hold on behind the door bracket it will turn around
no i won't follow her or the mural
not after that seagull
one of my works entitled the proustian theme in writing keats to benjamin bailey which elicited grins of approval from everyone
six or seven scientists who have read it
i set out to write a brief a history of english poetry for a publisher with a big name and then he began to compose that textbook of french literature
co comparative examples from the english literature
for american and british readers who had to keep me busy for the forties and the last volume which was almost ready for publication on the day of my arrest
i found a service
i taught english to a group of adults parisians of the sixteenth arrondissement
then during two winters there was a male gymnasium teacher
sometimes i used dating sites in among psychiatrists and public health professionals in order to visit various institutions with them such as orphanages orphanages and schools for juvenile delinquents where on pale with with the clumped lashes of adolescent girls i could look down from that full moon
the impunity that dreams give us
and now i want to state the following idea
within the age range girls meet between the ages of nine and fourteen which for some enchanted wanderers is twice or many times as much once older than them they discover their true essence the essence not human but nymphic
i
e
demonic
and these i propose to call the little chosen ones this way
nymphets
the reader will notice that i replace spatial concepts with concepts of time
more than that
i'd like him to see these limits are like visible outlines
mirrored shoals scarlet rocks
of the enchanted island where these moi are found nymphets and which is surrounded by a wide misty ocean
the question is
are all girls within these age limits nymphets
of course not
otherwise we the initiated we the lonely sailors we nympholeptsmen would have gone mad long ago
but also beauty it also does not serve as a criterion while vulgarity
or something else
is not a criterion
at least what is called vulgarity in this or that environment is not excludes without fail the presence of those mysterious features that a strange dreamlike grace that elusive changeable beauty
soul killing insinuating charms which distinguish a nymphet from peers who are incomparably more dependent on from the spatial world of one time phenomena rather than from the weightless one islands of enchanted time where lolita plays with her kind
within the same age limits the number of real nymphets is much higher less than the number of ugly or just cute
tm
or even cute but quite ordinary plump baggy cold skinned human looking girls with round eyes tummies with pigtails such as may or may not later turn into beautiful as they say women
look at the another nasty little crumpet in black stockings and a white hat reincarnating into a wondrous star of the screen
if you ask for it a normal person to mark the prettiest on the group in a picture of schoolgirls or girl scouts he doesn't always poke a nymphet
you have to be an artist and a madman playing endless games
sorrows with a bubble of hot poison in the root of the body and a super voluptuous flame forever burning in the sensitive ridge
o how we have to shiver and bury ourselves
in order to find out immediately by inexplicable signs on the slightly feline outline of the cheekbones on the fineness and silkiness of the members and other signs to list which despair shame tears of tenderness forbid me a small deadly demon in a crowd of ordinary children
she the nymphet stands among them unrecognized and unaware of herself its fabulous power
and yet
in view of the primacy of time in this witchcraft business the scientific the employee should be prepared to take into account that the following information is required
a difference of several years
i would say at least ten but usually at thirty or forty and up to ninety in the few known cases
in some cases
between a girl and a man so that he can fall under the spell of a nymphet
this is a question of adaptation lens a matter of some distance which is internal the eye with pleasant excitement prevails and the question of some the contrast that the mind perceives with the spasm of perverse pleasure
when i was a child and she was a child
sun edgar my annabella wasn't a nymphet to me
i was her my equal
in hindsight i was a faun myself on the same charmed island
on the island of time
but now in september after the expiration of the twenty nine years old i think i can see in her the original fatal obsession
we loved with premature love characterized by that frenzy that so often breaks up life mature people
i was a strong lad and i survived
but the poison remained in the wound and now i have grown up in the bosom of our civilization which allows a man to be attracted to a sixteen year old girl but does not a twelve year old girl
so it's no wonder that my adult life in europe was a bit of a mess
monstrously ambivalent
in the outside i had the so called normal intercourse with earth born women who have pumpkin breasts or pears but inside i was burned in a concentrated infernal furnace the lust aroused in me by every nymphet i meet to which i being a law respecting coward did not dare to approach
the bulky human females i was allowed to use them they served only as a palliative
i'm willing to believe that the sensations i extracted from natural coitus were as follows
more or less to those who experience normal large men hanging out with normal big women in that routine a rhythm that shakes the world
but the trouble is that these gentlemen i did not have the chance as i did to get a glimpse incomparably more piercing bliss
the faintest of my k's to a haze the world of dreams was a thousand times more colorful than the adulteries that had been committed
the manliest genius or the most talented impotent could imagine it
my world was split
i sensed more than one presence but of the two sexes neither of which was mine
both were female for the anatomist
for me who looked through a special lens
through the prism of feelings they were as different from each other as they were from each other
dream and mast
all this i now rationalize but in my twenties for twenty five years i have not been so clear about my suffering
my body knew exactly what it was craving but my mind refused to accept it
his every plea
sometimes i was afraid and ashamed sometimes i was afraid
reckless optimism
i was stifled by social restrictions
psychoanalysts beckoned me with a pseudo release from libidobeliberds
what are the only objects of a love letter
annabella's sisters confidantes and friends were awestruck to me
the corps de ballet i sometimes thought was an omen insanity
sometimes i told myself that it all depends on and that in fact there is nothing wrong with the fact that i'm freaking out about little girls
let me remind you to the reader that in england since the law was passed
in
on children and young persons the term girl child
vol
e
girl
is defined as a female person who has from born over eight and under fourteen years of age
after which from fourteen to seventeen the statute defines this person as a young lady

the term wayward child
wayward child
refers to technically to a girl between seven and seventeen years old who communicates with vicious and immoral persons
hugh broughton a polemical writer of the time of james the first proved that rahab she was a harlot when she was ten years old
all this is extremely interesting and i i assume you can already see how my mouth is foaming
a fit but no nothing foams i just let out a leach colorful fleas of happy thoughts in the appropriate cup
here are more pictures
here is virgil who
to quote the old english poet
a nymphet in the tone of one sang although throughout he preferred the boy's peritoneum
here are two of the more the unripe daughters of king ahnaten and his queen nefertiti at there were six of them nile shaven headed and naked
nothing but lots of rows of beads
with soft brown puppy paunchy with long ebony eyes calm sitting on pillows and completely intact after three thousand years
here are a number of ten year old brides who are being forced to sit on the couch
fascinium ivory stake in temples of the classical educational institutions
marriage and cohabitation with children occur more quite common in some areas of india
so eighty year old lepchans are combined with eight year olds girls and who cares
after all dante is mad he fell in love with his beatrice when she was only nine years old
so sparkly painted and lovely in a scarlet dress with a red head
expensive stones and this was in in florence on the a private feast in the merry month of may
when is petrarch mad i fell in love with my laurina who was a blonde nymphet of twelve years running in the wind through dust and flowers itself as flying flower in the midst of a beautiful plain visible from the vaucluse hills
but let's be prim and cultured
humbert humbert i tried very hard to be good
by god i tried
it applied to extremely careful to ordinary children to their cleanliness open and would not under any circumstances infringe on the rights of the child
the child's innocence if there was even the remotest possibility the scandal
but how the poor man's heart beat when in the midst of an innocent in the crowd of children he noticed a demon child enfant charmante et fourbe hazy eyes bright lips ten years of hard labor if you show her that you're looking at her
so life went on
humbert was he was perfectly capable of having intercourse with eve but lilith was the one he was talking about
he was dreaming

and the next one a well known feature is the first appearance
at years

my cup is full of fleas
a shipwreck
coral island
i'm alone with my cold daughter a drowned passenger
my dear this is only a game
what kind wonderful adventures i used to imagine sitting on a hard bench in a city park and pretending to be immersed in a dying book
nymphets frolicked freely around the peaceful polymath as if he were a child
he was a well regarded park statue or part of the chiaroscuro beneath an old tree
once a perfect beauty in a scottish petticoat slammed her heavily armed foot down on the floor beside me
a bench to dip your bare hands into me and tighten your belt a rollerblade and i disappeared into the sun replacing the old man with the old man
a fig leaf in a book while her brown curls fell on her face
a scratched knee and the tree shade i shared with her it pulsed and melted on her calf shining so close to mine chameleon cheeks
another time a red haired schoolgirl hung over me
i was in a subway car with an orange fluff under her arm
a revelation that's been in my blood for weeks
i could retell a lot of this kind of one sided miniature novels
the ending of some of them was seasoned with hell the drug
sometimes for example i noticed from the balcony at night in in a lighted window across the street a nymphet undressing in front of her
a helpful mirror
in this isolation in this distance the vision acquired an incredibly spicy charm which she made me a balcony spectator run at full speed to the door
to my lonely satisfaction
but with demonic suddenness gentle the pattern of nakedness that had already received the gift of worship from me was turning into the lamp illuminated the hideously bare elbow of a man in underwear a man reading a newspaper by an open window in a hot humid room
a hopeless summer night
jumping rope
jumping on one leg on the a panel marked up with chalk
the unforgettable old woman in black who she sat next to me on the park bench on the torture bench my bliss
the nymphet under me was trying to find rolled glass ball
and who asked me impudent witch does my stomach hurt
oh leave me in my in a blooming park in my mossy garden
let them play around me forever never growing up
by the way
i often asked myself what happened to them afterwards with these nymphets
in our iron grid world of causes and consequences could not the shudder i had stolen from them have been a sign of the consequences
affect their future
she was mine and she'll never know
good
but wouldn't it affect her later wouldn't i have messed her up
somehow in her future life by involving her image in the your secret voluptuousness
oh it has been and will be the subject of great ones and terrible doubts
i found out however what they turn into these charming people
crazy nymphets when they grow up
i remember walking once in the late afternoon on a busy street in the spring in the center of paris
a small thin girl passed me on an ambulance high heeled footpath
we both looked back at the same time
she she stopped and i walked over to her
head
it barely reached to my breast fur
her face was round and dimpled like a child's
it is often found in young french women
i liked her long lashes and a pearl gray tailleur that clung to her youthful body
a body that still held
and that was the nymphic echo a chill of pleasure a soaring in the loins
something childish mixed in with the professional frbtillement of her small smart ass
i inquired about her price and she immediately replied with musical silver precision
a bird is a real bird
cent
i tried to haggle but she appreciated the wild deaf desire is in my eyes looking down at her from this height
round forehead and rudimentary hat
bouquet and bow
tant pis she said with a wink and pretended to leave
i thought
it was only three years ago that i could have seen her coming home from school
this picture solved the problem
she led the way take me up the usual steep stairs with the usual bell ringing notifying a gentleman who does not wish to meet another person the master that the path is free or not free a bleak path to a nasty little room consisting of a bed and a bidet
as usual she first of all i called for my petit cadeau and as usual i i asked her name
monique
and age
eighteen
i was great you are familiar with the banal tricks of prostitutes
you hear from all of them this dixuit is a clear tweet with a touch of dreamy deception which they publish poor things up to ten times a day
but in this case it was clear to everyone that monica was adding rather than subtracting i'm about two years old
this i have deduced from many details of her life
a compact chiseled and oddly undeveloped body
