Along with Lagrange, he was the greatest mathematician of the 18th century and is considered one of the greatest mathematicians in history. Euler was the author of more than 850 works (including two dozen fundamental monographs) in mathematical analysis, differential geometry, number theory, approximate calculus, celestial mechanics, mathematical physics, optics, ballistics, shipbuilding, music theory and other fields. He studied medicine, chemistry, botany, aeronautics, and many European and ancient languages. Academician of the St. Petersburg, Berlin, Turin, Lisbon and Basel Academies of Sciences, foreign member of the Paris Academy of Sciences. The first Russian member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He spent almost half of his life in Russia, where he made a significant contribution to the formation of Russian science. In 1726 he was invited to work in St. Petersburg, where he moved a year later.
